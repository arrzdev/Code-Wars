# Code Wars
> This is the repository of all the code written by me during the competition Code Wars. Code Wars is a team coding competition each team with ~3/4 members were I participated alone.

## Leet Code
This phase consisted in a series of algorithmic problems, the ones I successfully passed the tests can be found on ./leetcode

## Frenetic Code
This phase consisted in 30 min of "frenetic coding", the problems of this phase were simpler and literally some of them could be implemented in 30 seconds. I just made 3 because I prefered to stay on the leetcode problems since they were more challenging.
>Placed 7th alone in ~12 teams (Leet Code + Frenetic Code).


## Project
In this phase we had 4 hours to implement one of the two possible projects (url shortner service and a bank service).
I developed a shortner url service (backend + frontend).
- Backend: Flask API (Python)
- Frontend: HTML + CSS + JS (originally wanted to use React but didn't had time.)

>Placed 3th alone in ~12 teams (winning a 100â‚¬ prize).
